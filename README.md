# Numerical Methods in Python

This project contains a collection of numerical approximation algorithms implemented in Python, including methods for:

- Root-finding
- Interpolation
- Numerical integration
- Solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

These algorithms were originally developed as part of a university-level Numerical Methods course. The goal was to explore and implement foundational mathematical techniques commonly used in engineering and scientific computing.

All implementations are included in the Jupyter Notebook `numerical_methods.ipynb`, along with clear explanations, step-by-step code, visualizations, and example problems.

## 💻 Tools & Libraries

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – for numerical calculations  
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) – for interactive visualizations  
- [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) (initially used) – for symbolic input and dynamic function definitions  

> ⚠️ While the original project was designed to receive user-defined functions via SymPy, this version simplifies execution by hardcoding all functions and input values inside the code. This makes it easier to follow and test each algorithm without external input.
